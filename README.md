# ExtremeLearningMachine
An extreme learning machine neural network used to learn off of the Kaggle dataset "Predicting a Pulsar Star"

The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/pavanraj159/predicting-a-pulsar-star

The goal of this project was to implement a neural network from scratch. I chose an extreme learning machine for its quickness to learn (often within one cycle).
